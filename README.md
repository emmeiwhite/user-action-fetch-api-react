# React Topics Covered Thus Far:

1. Component: Piece of the User Interface. In React, we divide User Interface into components
2. JSX: A component returns something called the JSX, which is a syntax similar to HTML which describe what we see on the page
3. State: Internal data (variable) whose value is preserved across renders
4. State & UI: When the state of a component changes, the UI gets updated. State & UI are in sync to maintain application's state as to say
5. Props: Data passed from the Parent to the child component in a component tree is called props. Props is external data to the component and is read-only. Think of Props as Function arguments being passed to a function.
